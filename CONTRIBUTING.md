# Guiding Principles for Contribution

Thank you for taking the time to contribute! Together, we will create something amazing.

## Before You Get Started

Before contributing, be sure to read through the code of conduct for contribution

### Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we encourage all people to contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, and participating in other activities.

## How Do I Start Contributing?

Help on Carbon Shared Tests is always welcome and there is always something that can be improved. For example, documentation (like the text you are reading now) can always use improvement, code can always be clarified, variables or functions can always be renamed or commented on, and there is always a need for more test coverage. If you see something that you think should be fixed, take ownership! Here is how you get started:

### GitHub Workflow

To start working on code, please refer to the [GitHub Workflow](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

### Start with Issues

When contributing, always start with issues. After picking up an issue, writing code, or updating a document, your work will be reviewed and merged. For more information, check out the following document: [Types of Issue and Issue States](#type-of-issue-and-issue-state).

### Once You've Made Changes, Open a Pull Request

Pull requests are often simply referred to as "PR". In general, we follow the standard [github pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) process.

The project team will provide structured labels to your PR, which need to be updated based on your PR status. Look to the below table for guidance. For Pull Request Labels, click [here](#Pull-request-labels).

Before sending pull requests, make sure your changes have passed all tests.

### Code Review

There are two aspects of code review: giving and receiving.

It will be easier for your pull request to receive reviews if you consider the criteria the reviewers follow while working. Remember to:

* Follow the project coding conventions
* Write detailed commit messages
* Break large changes into a logical series of smaller patches, which are easy to understand individually and combine to solve a broader issue
* Label PRs with appropriate pull request labels to indicate status for maintainers

Note: if your pull request isn't getting enough attention, you can contact the maintainer to find a reviewer

### Testing

Testing is the responsibility of all contributors.

## Additional Notes

Issue and pull request labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/en/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in.

If you have suggestions for new labels, please open an issue on the project source code repository. If you notice a missing label on a repository, then please open an issue on that repository.
