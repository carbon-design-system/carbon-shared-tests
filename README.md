# Project Overview

A test suite of re-usable UI unit tests aligned to the [Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/). Tests focus on user interactions to verify consistent behavior across implementations. The suite is UI and testing framework agnostic using the [Exported Tests](https://github.com/IBM/exported-tests#project-overview) architecture. This project is a collaboration between teams creating and using Carbon components.
